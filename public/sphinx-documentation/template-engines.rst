Pug
---

Express Application Generator can be invoked ``express --view=pug myapp``.

You can also use pug like this: ``pug -o html -P file.pug``. This will convert a pug file (file.pug) to pretty (-P) html and put the html file in a directory called html (-o html). Note that file.pug will be unaltered.
