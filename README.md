# Express With Steve

This repo consists of my own notes to help me write node express apps.

The documenation is written using *Sphinx*.

Included in this repo is a simple express app that serves the html files generated by *Sphinx*. The repo is connected to a *Heroku* server so the documentation can be seen at https://express-with-steve.herokuapp.com
